# Dots Bootstrap

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TGGamer01/Dots/main/bootstrap.sh | bash

## ✅ Final Notes

Your bootstrap script will now:
1. Clone the repo (if not already present)
2. Detect distro + shell
3. Install `yay` on Arch
4. Install `common.txt` + `DISTRO.txt` pkgs
5. Run `stow -t ~ home config`
6. Source your shell configs

Would you like me to also generate a **template layout of all the files with content filled in** (like a `tree` view + ready-to-go text for each)? It’ll be plug-and-play ready for your repo.
